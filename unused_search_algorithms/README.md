# search_by_synonyms.js 

This is the initial implementation. It searches for similar issues by looking at the exact title words (not including filler words like "a", "the", etc.), as well as its synonyms. It then displays 5 of the issues with titles containing any of these words or its synonyms, and displays them in no particular order.
